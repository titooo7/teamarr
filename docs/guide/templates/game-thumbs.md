# Game Thumbs Integration

[Game Thumbs](https://github.com/sethwv/game-thumbs) is an optional external service that generates dynamic program artwork for sports events. It creates matchup images with team logos, scores, and broadcast network badges.

{: .note }
Game Thumbs is a separate project maintained by [@sethwv](https://github.com/sethwv). Teamarr does not require Game Thumbs, but it significantly enhances the visual experience.

## Features

- Dynamic matchup artwork with team logos
- Multiple art styles (cover, logo, badge variations)
- Broadcast network badges (ESPN, FOX, etc.)
- Fallback images when teams aren't found
- Support for all major leagues

## Documentation

For full documentation, visit: [game-thumbs-docs.swvn.io](https://game-thumbs-docs.swvn.io)

## Hosted Options

If you don't want to self-host, there are community-hosted instances available:

| URL | User |
|-----|------|
| `https://game-thumbs.swvn.io` | @sethwv |
| `https://sportslogos.jesmann.com` | @jesmannstlPanda |

{: .important }
Hosted instances are provided as a community service and may have usage limits or availability constraints.

## Self-Hosting

To run your own instance:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name game-thumbs \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ghcr.io/sethwv/game-thumbs:latest
```

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sethwv/game-thumbs) for detailed setup instructions.
