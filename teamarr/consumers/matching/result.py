"""Match Result System for stream-to-event matching.

Clean result hierarchy with three discrete categories:
- FILTERED: Pre-match, didn't attempt to match (stream excluded by configuration)
- FAILED: Matching attempted but couldn't find event
- MATCHED: Successfully matched to an event
- EXCLUDED: Matched successfully but won't create channel/EPG

Each category has reason subtypes for detailed breakdown.

Refactored Jan 2026 for clean separation:
- FILTERED = pre-match filtering only (regex, not_event)
- FAILED = matching phase failures (no teams, no events)
- EXCLUDED = post-match exclusions (lifecycle timing, league mismatch)
