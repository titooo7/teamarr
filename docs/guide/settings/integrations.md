# Integration Settings

Configure connections to external services.

## Dispatcharr Integration

Connect Teamarr to Dispatcharr for automatic channel management.

### Connection Settings

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Enable** | Toggle Dispatcharr integration on/off |
| **URL** | Dispatcharr server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9191`) |
| **Username** | Dispatcharr login username |
| **Password** | Dispatcharr login password |

Use the **Test** button to verify your connection.

### Connection Status

A status badge shows the current connection state:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Connected** | Successfully communicating with Dispatcharr |
| **Disconnected** | Configured but unable to connect |
| **Error** | Connection failed (hover for error details) |
| **Not Configured** | Integration not yet set up |

### EPG Source

Select which EPG source in Dispatcharr to associate with Teamarr-managed channels.

### Default Channel Profiles

Select which channel profiles to assign to Teamarr-managed channels by default. Individual [event groups can override](../event-groups/creating-groups#channel-profiles) this setting.

- **All profiles selected** - Channels appear in all profiles
- **None selected** - Channels don't appear in any profile
- **Specific profiles** - Channels appear only in selected profiles

#### Dynamic Wildcards

In addition to selecting specific profiles, you can use wildcards that dynamically create and assign profiles based on the event:

| Wildcard | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{sport}` | Creates/assigns profile named after the sport | `football`, `basketball` |
| `{league}` | Creates/assigns profile named after the league | `nfl`, `nba`, `epl` |

For example, selecting profiles `[1, {sport}]` would assign all channels to profile 1, plus dynamically create and assign to a sport-specific profile.

{: .note }
Profile assignment is enforced on every EPG generation run. Wildcard profiles are created in Dispatcharr automatically if they don't exist.

See [Dispatcharr Integration](../dispatcharr-integration) for setup details.

## Local Caching

Teamarr caches team and league data from ESPN and TheSportsDB to improve performance.

### Cache Status

- Stale indicator if cache needs refresh

### Refresh Cache

Manually refresh the cache to pull the latest team and league data.
