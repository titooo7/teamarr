"""Cross-group consolidation enforcement.

When multiple groups have channels for the same event, consolidates
streams into one channel based on group priority.

Use case:
- Multi-league group (ESPN+) matches an NHL game
- Single-league group (NHL) also has that game
- Move ESPN+ streams to NHL channel, delete ESPN+ channel

Respects overlap_handling per group:
- create_all: Keep separate channels, no consolidation
- skip: Delete channel but don't move streams
- add_stream/add_only: Move streams then delete (default)
