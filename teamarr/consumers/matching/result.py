"""Match Result System for stream-to-event matching.

Comprehensive result hierarchy with three categories:
- FILTERED: Stream excluded before matching attempted
- FAILED: Matching attempted but couldn't complete
- MATCHED: Successfully matched to an event

Ported from V1 with simplifications for V2:
- Removed legacy string compatibility
- Removed unsupported sport detection (handled by classifier)
- Added MatchMethod enum (replaces MatchedTier)
- Added confidence score for fuzzy matches
